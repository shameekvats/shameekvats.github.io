**This website is under development** 

I am a Materials Scientist and R&D Engineer dedicated to bridging the digital and physical realms through advanced manufacturing, microelectronics, robotics, and programming. With a Ph.D. in [electrospinning](https://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/49301), I have gained extensive expertise in fiber spinning and other cutting-edge fabrication techniques. My skills and experiences across multiple countries have offered me with a global perspective on tackling complex engineering challenges.

My work focuses on developing innovative solutions that integrate:  
- **Fiber Spinning** : Production of nanofibers to pioneer new material formulations and manufacturing methods.
- **Project Management:** Co-organizing and co-managing electronic music festivals for [Beyond Music ASBL](https://www.beyondmusic.lu/).  
- **Additive Manufacturing & 3D Modeling** : Utilizing [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/en/) to design parametric models and 3D printing techniques to design and prototype functional components.  
- **Embedded & IoT Systems** : Experimenting with platforms like [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/?variant=raspberry-pi-5-16gb) and [Microbit](https://microbit.org/) to create interactive, real-world applications.  
- **Data-Driven Automation** : Leveraging Python for automation, data analysis, and the optimization of research and development processes.  

I believe that curiosity, collaboration, and creativity are key to transforming challenges into opportunities. In my spare time, I enjoy playing [cricket](https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/shameek-vats-1230626) and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50895425-shameek-vats), pursuits that keep me energized and inspire new ideas.  

If youâ€™re interested in discussing potential collaborations, research projects, or any forward-thinking ventures at the intersection of materials science, advanced manufacturing, and digital innovation, please reach out.
