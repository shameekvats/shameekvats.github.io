# Welcome to My World of Innovation

Where a well-fueled cup of coffee, a passion for cricket, and an insatiable curiosity come together to spark limitless creativity. I'm **Shameek Vats**, a Materials Scientist and R&D Engineer with an international background, blending digital ingenuity with hands-on craftsmanship.

With a PhD in electrospinning and deep expertise in advanced additive manufacturing, microelectronics, robotics, and programming, I thrive on transforming challenges into opportunities. Today, I channel that energy into:

- **3D Printing & Modeling:** Crafting detailed designs in Onshape and turning them into tangible creations.
- **Modern Web Development:** Building responsive, intuitive websites that marry form and function.
- **Embedded & IoT Projects:** Experimenting with Raspberry Pi and Microbit to bring interactive ideas to life.
- **Data-Driven Innovation:** Using Python for automation and insights that enhance every project.

Whether I'm engineering a new solution in the lab (and playing) on the cricket field, I believe that curiosity, creativity, and a bit of humor are the perfect ingredients for groundbreaking prototypes.

Let's connect and collaborate on turning visionary ideas into reality!
