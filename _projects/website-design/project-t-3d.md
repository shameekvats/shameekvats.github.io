A clean, narrative site that documents my 3D printing evolution—from early experiments to advanced, multi-material builds.

- **Goals:** Share the learning arc, show milestones, and make the progression from hobbyist to maker transparent.
- **Highlights:** Timeline-style storytelling, focused sections for process, philosophy, and outcomes, plus embedded media for prints and CAD.
- **Stack & workflow:** Built with Astro for fast static delivery, paired with lightweight styling and structured content blocks.
