Electrospinning is a process that uses electrical forces to draw ultra-fine fibers from a polymer solution, creating lightweight, porous nanofiber mats. These mats find applications in areas like filtration, tissue engineering, and advanced composite materials.

Holding a PhD in electrospinning, I have gained hands-on experience by designing my own setups and operating a range of machinesâ€”both commercial and self-built. My work has taken me across Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, and Slovenia, where I explored innovative techniques to produce high-quality nanofibers. Below are images and videos that capture the process and showcase the intricate results of these projects.
