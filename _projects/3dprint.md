3D printing, especially using Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), has changed the way I quickly create parts for electronics and detailed projects. By using advanced plastic materials, I can build strong and precise pieces that fit perfectly with electronic devices. Thanks to my background in materials science and polymers, I carefully choose materials that are both tough and capable of capturing fine details. This method turns simple plastic filaments into well-made prototypes and final parts, from custom cases and connector housings to supports and interactive components. The flexibility of FDM not only inspires new ideas in design and engineering but also helps turn creative concepts into real-world products, making it an essential tool in my work.

Below are some examples of 3D prints and prototypes I made.

A custom wireless mouse with a unique 3D printed case and then carefully assembled the hardware, including a wireless dongle for seamless operation. The result was a fully functional device with practical electronics assembly.

These lamps were 3D printed, then fitted with LED lights and tea lights to create a warm, ambient glow. Each design transform everyday objects into artistic and functional pieces.

3D designing with parametric software plays a vital role in prototyping. By carefully measuring the precise dimensions needed, everyday objects can be designed into digital models before printing it. 

The ability to accurately record measurements and convert them into exact 3D designs means that every object is tailored for its intended use. This approach not only streamlines the prototyping process but also makes it easy to bring custom, practical solutions to life, ready to be 3D printed as needed.

Below are some 3D designs that show how combining digital design and 3D printing can turn ideas into practical prototypes.
