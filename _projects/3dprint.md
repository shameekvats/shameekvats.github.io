3D printing, especially using Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), has changed the way I quickly create parts for electronics and detailed projects. By using advanced plastic materials, I can build strong and precise pieces that fit perfectly with electronic devices. Thanks to my background in materials science and polymers, I carefully choose materials that are both tough and capable of capturing fine details. This method turns simple plastic filaments into well-made prototypes and final parts, from custom cases and connector housings to supports and interactive components. The flexibility of FDM not only inspires new ideas in design and engineering but also helps turn creative concepts into real-world products, making it an essential tool in my work.
