### Pi-hole Project

I utilized the [Raspberry Pi zero](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/) capabilities to transform it into a network-wide ad blocker through the [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) project. By configuring it as a DNS sinkhole, I intercepted and filtered out unwanted advertisements and tracking domains before they reached my devices. This approach resulted in a cleaner, faster, and more secure browsing experience, while also reducing overall bandwidth consumption and boosting network performance.
