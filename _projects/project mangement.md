After the resounding success of our previous event in 2023, we made a triumphant return to Vianden Castle on an even grander scale. The project transformed the historic castle grounds into an electronic music festival, featuring three distinct stages that offered unique atmospheres and musical experiences.

The event was organized with a cross-functional team of 50 dedicated professionals coordinated every aspect of the project, resulting in an outreach that attracted over 1,000 enthusiastic attendees. A carefully curated lineup of more than 10 national and international artists showcased a balanced blend of local and global talent, underscoring the strategic and creative efforts invested in the festival.
