This project marks the beginning of my exploration into industrial robotics. I set up a simulated production line using a Dobot Magician robot, where a continuous conveyor belt delivers cubes in different colors. Programmed in Python, the robot picks up each cube, moves it to a sensor that identifies its color, and then sorts it into the appropriate container. By working with three distinct colors, this experiment not only demonstrates basic automation but also fuels my curiousity for merging robotics with digital programming. Itâ€™s an exciting early step in my journey into industrial robotics and refine my skills in Python-driven automation.

Below is a video showcasing the setup in action.
