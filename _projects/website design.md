# Website Design

I enjoy creating clean, functional websites that effectively communicate information while offering a smooth user experience. Below are two examples of websites I have designed and developed:

### Sports Club: [Warriors Cricket Club](https://warriorscricket.eu/)
A minimalistic portfolio website that highlights creative projects and professional achievements.

### Research Project: [BioCel-3D](https://www.biocel3d.eu/)
An engaging blog focused on intuitive navigation and clear content presentation.

The design approach for both sites emphasizes simplicity, user engagement, and clarity without being overly flashy.
